My first independent student project, inspired by linear algebra lessons. In my linear algebra calculator, I described the basic operations to be automated. I consider it unique and superior to the web analogs that are widespread on the Internet, as it handles any vectors with any dimensions (which may not coincide) in its operations.

Available operations:
1. solve a SLAE by the Gaussian method
2. scalar product of vectors
3. find a determinant of the matrix
4. find an inverse matrix
5. fing a rank of the matrix
6. check the system for linear independence
7. find the basis of the system
8. solve the SLAE by the Cramer method (do not work)
9. find the basis of the sum and intersection of subspaces
10. matrix of transition from basis to basis
11. the coordinates of the vector in another basis
12. find the matrix of the linear operator in another basis
13. find the matrix of the linear operator in another basis(in pair of basis)
14. Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process
15. find the orthogonal projection and orthogonal complement of the vector
16. find an orthogonal complement to the linear shell
17. find the matrix of the conjugate linear operator
18. find eigenvectors of a linear operator + normal Jordan form
